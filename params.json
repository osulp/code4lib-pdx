In the spirit of celebrating the conference's 10th year, OSU wants to bring Code4Lib back to Oregon.  \r\n\r\n![White Stag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Portland_Oregon_-_White_Stag_sign.jpg/853px-Portland_Oregon_-_White_Stag_sign.jpg)CC-BY-SA Steve Morgon (via. Wikimedia Commons)\r\n\r\nWe propose to host the conference in downtown Portland.  We have had discussions with several downtown hotels including the Portland Marriott Downtown Waterfront and Hilton Portland & Executive Tower.  These venues have the capacity to host the conference at between 400 and 500 attendees.  Though final rates will depend on details, **our target is to keep registration near $165; the group hotel rate would be between $140 and $160.**\r\n\r\nDates available include the weeks of February 2nd, 9th, and 25th. \r\n\r\nAlternative hotel options range from the [NW Portland Hostel](http://nwportlandhostel.com/) which has shared dorms from $21/night and private rooms between $50 and $70. There are many other hotels in the area, ranging from the Econolodge near the PSU campus just south of Downtown to the uber-hip Ace Hotel.\r\n\r\n## The City\r\n\r\nPortland sits on the Columbia and Willamette rivers.  With a population of just over 600,000, the city is known for its outdoor activity, scenic bridges, coffee, beer, food carts, and [twee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia_(TV_series)).  The climate is mild (if wet), and the area is green year-round.  For a late February or early March conference, there's even a chance for cherry blossoms.\r\n\r\n![Waterfront Park Cherry Blossoms](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8116/8606999627_69fe929138_c.jpg)CC-BY [Flickr User: samchurchill](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samchurchill/)\r\n\r\n## Transportation & Accommodations\r\n\r\nPortland International Airport has direct flights throughout the US and Canada, as well as Japan.  Portland's light rail system (MAX) runs directly from the airport to potential downtown conference locations and hotels.  You can also reach Portland via Amtrak from up and down the west coast.  Union Station is a ten minute walk from potential venues. \r\n\r\n![St. Johns Bridge](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/83/214822573_ddd63d0e40_b.jpg)CC-BY [Flickr User: OceanYamaha](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oceanyamaha/)\r\n\r\nPortland is an easy city to get around, with small blocks designed for walkability.  MAX, streetcar, and buses make it easy to get just about anywhere from downtown.  With any luck our beleaguered bike share will also be up and running, giving you another option for moving about.\r\n\r\n## Social\r\n\r\nThe city's Cultural District is within walking distance of downtown hotels.  The Multnomah County Library and Portland Art Museum are in this area, as well as the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, the Portland Center for Performing Arts, and the Oregon Historical Society.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant and dining scene has emerged in recent years to make Portland a notable food destination.  The city is known for its over 700 food carts, and other dining options have grown along with the breweries and the nearby wine regions.  The restaurants are creative, relaxed, and usually have great vegetarian and vegan options.  Portland is also a brunch town.  If you are in town before or after the conference, it would be worth it to beat the crowd to [Mother's](http://www.mothersbistro.com/), [Broder](http://www.broderpdx.com/), or [Toast](http://www.toastpdx.com/brunch.html).\r\n\r\nPortland has in the range of 50 breweries (many with multiple pubs or taphouses scattered across the city) and serves as a hub for a larger Oregon beer scene. Unique offerings are available from Eugene, Bend, Hood River, Newport, and up and down the Willamette Valley.\r\n\r\nOther nearby places of interest include [Powell's City of Books](http://www.powells.com/locations/powells-city-of-books/) (the largest new & used bookstore in the world) and its technical books annex, [Voodoo Doughnuts](http://voodoodoughnut.com/), \r\n\r\n## Organizing Committee\r\n* Evviva Weinraub Lajoie\r\n* Tom Johnson\r\n* Hui Zhang\r\n* Ryan Wick\r\n* Trey Terrell","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
