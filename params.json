In the spirit of celebrating the conference's 10th year, OSU wants to bring Code4Lib back to Oregon.  \r\n\r\n![White Stag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Portland_Oregon_-_White_Stag_sign.jpg/853px-Portland_Oregon_-_White_Stag_sign.jpg)CC-BY-SA Steve Morgon (via. Wikimedia Commons)\r\n\r\nWe propose to host the conference in downtown Portland.  We have had discussions with several downtown hotels including the Portland Marriott Downtown Waterfront and Hilton Portland & Executive Tower.  These venues have the capacity to host the conference at between 400 and 500 attendees.  Though final rates will depend on details, **our target is to keep registration near $165; the group hotel rate would be between $140 and $160.**\r\n\r\n## The City\r\n\r\nPortland sits on the Columbia and Willamette rivers.  With a population of just over 600,000, the city is known for its outdoor activity, scenic bridges, coffee, beer, food carts, and [twee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia_(TV_series)).  The climate is mild (if wet), and the area is green year-round.  For a late February or early March conference, there's even a chance for cherry blossoms.\r\n\r\n![Waterfront Park Cherry Blossoms](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8116/8606999627_69fe929138_c.jpg)CC-BY [Flickr User: samchurchill](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samchurchill/)\r\n\r\n## Transportation & Accommodations\r\n\r\nPortland International Airport has direct flights throughout the US and Canada, as well as Japan.  Portland's light rail system (MAX) runs directly from the airport to potential downtown conference locations and hotels.  You can also reach Portland via Amtrak from up and down the west coast.  Union Station is a ten minute walk from potential venues. \r\n\r\nPortland is an easy city to get around, with small blocks designed for walkability.  MAX, streetcar, and buses make it easy to get just about anywhere from downtown.  With any luck our beleaguered bike share will also be up and running, giving you another option for moving about.\r\n\r\n## Social\r\n\r\n{so much here}\r\n\r\n## Organizing Committee\r\n* Evviva Weinraub Lajoie\r\n* Tom Johnson\r\n* Hui Zhang\r\n* Ryan Wick\r\n* Trey Terrell","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
