<a name="the-conference" class="anchor" href="#the-conference"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Conference</h2>

<p>Oregon State University hosted the first Code4Lib conference in Corvallis, Oregon in 2005.  In the spirit of celebrating the conference's 10th year, OSU wants to bring Code4Lib back to Oregon.  </p>

<p>We propose to host the conference in downtown Portland.  We have had discussions with several downtown hotels including the Portland Marriott Downtown Waterfront and Hilton Portland &amp; Executive Tower.  These venues have the capacity to host the conference at between 400 and 500 attendees.  Though final rates will depend on details, <strong>our target is to keep registration near $165; the group hotel rate would be between $140 and $160.</strong></p>

<a name="the-city" class="anchor" href="#the-city"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The City</h2>

<p>Portland sits on the Columbia and Willamette rivers.  With a population of just over 600,000, the city is known for its outdoor activity, scenic bridges, coffee, beer, food carts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia_(TV_series)">twee</a>.  The climate is mild (if wet), and the area is green year-round.  For a late February or early March conference, there's even a chance for cherry blossoms.</p>

<a name="transportation--accommodations" class="anchor" href="#transportation--accommodations"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transportation &amp; Accommodations</h2>

<p>Portland International Airport has direct flights throughout the US and Canada, as well as Japan.  Portland's light rail system (MAX) runs directly from the airport to potential downtown conference locations and hotels.  You can also reach Portland via Amtrak from up and down the west coast.  Union Station is a ten minute walk from potential venues. </p>

<p>Portland is an easy city to get around, with small blocks designed for walkability.  MAX, streetcar, and buses make it easy to get just about anywhere from downtown.  With any luck our beleaguered bike share will also be up and running, giving you another option for moving about.</p>
